COMMENT
    This mech is based on the "built-in" pas channel from NEURON 6.1.
    Johannes Luthman has taken it to be used for the DCN neuron model
    and made the following modifications: 
    - g has been renamed gbar in accordance with the other DCN channels
    - e has been changed from -70 to -66 mV
