COMMENT by Johannes Luthman:

    This mechanism is based on DCNsyn.mod in this project. What's added here is
    paired-pulse depression of the synapse's current, based on Shin et al, 2007
    (PLOSone issue 5, e485, page 2), on which the changes in terminology
    compared to DCNsyn.mod are based.
    The depression is implemented via the change from [g = B - A] in DCNsyn.mod
    to [g = (B - A) * deprLevel] here, and the calculation of deprLevel on each
    input (NETRECEIVE).
