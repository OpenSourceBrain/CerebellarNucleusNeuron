TITLE Small conductance calcium dependent potassium current (SK) of deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) neuron
COMMENT
    This channel's conductance is affected by the calcium concentration which
    has been accumulated through the CaHVA channel and kept track of by CaConc.mod.
    Calcium entry through the CaLVA channel is kept track of by CalConc.mod
    and doesn't affect the SK channel.
